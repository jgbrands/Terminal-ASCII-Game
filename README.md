# Terminal-ASCII-Game
Creating a simple Windows terminal game with ASCII characters for graphics to learn everything from good code practices to using Github.

A terminal game was one of the first "big" projects I did when I was at the beginning of learning C, this is a more improved version using my new acquired knowledge.
Still, this code is probably scuffed as hell, since I'm a beginner.
